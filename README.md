# Portfolio Challenge
By: Jake Smith

## Project Description
In this project, I was tasked with creating my own online portfolio from scratch, using only CSS and HTML. The idea is that in the future,
once I've added more functionality and improved my ability to design, I will be able to update it into a more professional project that
potential employers will be impressed by. While it's not perfect, soon I'll have the skills to make it so.

## Tools Used
The only languages used were HTML and CSS. I had to use instructions from my teacher, Katherine Thiim, as well as plenty of help from 
websites such as w3schools and MDN. Several classmates helped give me feedback as well. Lastly, I reckon I watched roughly 10 hours of
Youtube videos in order to help understand ideas like media queries and flexbox.
